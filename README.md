# reddit-user-analyser

A tool to analyse a Reddit user.

I made this in early 2017 to familiarise myself with front-end view library concepts and didn't really know what the hell I was doing. I am planning to remake this entirely with React, add many more features and improve the performance/UX based on the things I've learnt in web development over the past 2 years. Stay tuned!
